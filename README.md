# Start-up-Success-Prediction
AI algorithms project


Investors often suffer from huge losses for investing in the wrong company. In real life, it is daunting for investors to predict success for a start-up. 
My model helps to predict the success rate of the start-up companies based on various parameters like location, funding, type of business, etc. Using this model, 
investors will get a fair idea on which companies they should target for investment. A company will be considered a success based on the company’s mergers and acquisitions. 
A company will be considered a failure if it was forced to shut down.
Based on the rejections, a company will be motivated to come up with new products and new solutions.
